# Model-free-DRL-algorithms
Pytorch implementation of current popular model free (both discrete and continuous action space) algorithms
Support:
1. Tensorboard for real-time observing reward
2. DQN, DDQN, D3QN, D3QN-PER, C51, NoisyDQN for discrete action space problems
3. DDPG, PPO, SAC, SAC-Auto, TD3, REDQ for continuous action space problems
